# PhaseFieldModeling
This is a numerical implementation of the Fourier Spectral Method, for the solution of multicomponent non-conserved Allenâ€“Cahn equations in phase-field modeling.

This contains a serial and parallel code _fft_ca_v1_serial.f90_ and _fft_ca_v1_parallel.f90_ for running the same. MPI is used to parallelize the serial code.
